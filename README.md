For the program, I called 3 APIs: one to get all studies, one to get molecular profile ids, and one to get a list of mutations according to that molecular profile id. The flow of the code was methodical; first I called an API to get all the studies from the website, next I filtered through all of those studies for just TCGA studies which narrowed down the sample size, in each of the studies in the TCGA study, I got the study Id and the cancer name. Next using the study Id, I called an API for a molecular profile ID with the criteria that matched up with that study Id. That API returns multiple molecular profile Ids so instead of using a get API, which would only allow me to pass one molecular profile Id at once, I used a post API which allowed me to pass all the molecular profile Ids at once and get all the mutations. I stored all of the molecular profile Ids that were returned in an array and passed that array into the post mutation Id. Then for each of the mutations, I pulled out the key pieces of data that we needed for the project and put those in a dictionary, which I then appended to a list. At the very end of the code I used the csv writing tool and wrote the list of dictionaries into a write file and exported it to Google Sheets
